# Zingo! 
**By Team Gamerplaza**

## 😞 Problem Statement

Globally, more than 264 million people of all ages suffer from depression and other mental disorders. Due to constant fear and frequent lockdowns, psychological issues like anxiety, emotional instability, depression and other advanced mental disorders like schizophrenia, dementia, Alzeimer etc. have increased manifolds since the onset of Covid. This problem calls for solutions like the one our team has prepared in the form of  a platform called Zingo.

## 💡 Our Solution

We, the team Gamerplaza, have come up with a solution that we believe would help in solving the aforementioned dilemmas. We have developed a platform where we are endeavoring to bring people with some sort of mental problems, doctors, meditation guides and volunteers together to resolve these issues discreetly.
